# Understanding web services concepts (client-server model)
## **Server-Client Relationship**
1. **The client sends a request** for specific information (**Request**).  
2. **The server processes the request** and sends back a **response**.  
3. **The client receives the data** and displays it in the **UI**.
### Example
When you access **Google** on your phone, **your phone acts as the client**, sending a request for the webpage. The **server** is the computer that processes the request and sends back the **Google web page** for your phone to display.

## Clinet (User - PC, Mobile)
- **The entity requesting the service**: The component or system that initiates a request.  
- **The user interface (UI) role**: Includes web browsers (**Chrome, Firefox, etc.**) or mobile apps that interact with the service.  
- **Example**
  - When a user accesses a website, the **browser (client)** sends a request to the **server** to retrieve data.## Server

## Server
- **Systems that receive, process, and respond to client requests**: These handle incoming requests and send appropriate responses.  
- **Core functions**: Store data, process business logic, and manage authentication and security.
- **Example**
  - When you log in to a website, the **server** verifies your **username and password** before returning a response.

## Front-end & Back-end in Server
### Frontend (What You See & Interact With)
- The menu board, the cashier, the coffee cup—everything you see and interact with is the **frontend**.
- In web development, this is the **website or app UI** (buttons, images, text, forms, etc.).
- Technologies: **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue.js**
### Backend (What Happens Behind the Scenes)
- The coffee-making process in the kitchen, storing ingredients, handling payments—this is the **backend**.
- In web development, the backend handles **data, logic, and communication with databases.**
- Technologies: **Node.js, Python (Django, Flask), Java (Spring), SQL, NoSQL**
### Example : How Frontend & Backend Work Together?
- You order a coffee (frontend sends a request).
- The barista makes the coffee (backend processes data).
- You receive the coffee (frontend displays the response).
For example, when you log in to a website:
- Frontend: You enter your username & password.
- Backend: The server checks if your credentials are correct.
- Frontend: If correct, you see your account page. If wrong, you see an error message.
